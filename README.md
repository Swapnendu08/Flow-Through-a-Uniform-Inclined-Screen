# Flow-Through-a-Uniform-Inclined-Screen
It is a CFD project of determining the velocity and pressure distribution at different angles of inclined screen using COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS simulation Software which solves the Asymptotic Equation 
and gives us the results like Velocity and Contour Profile, Pressure Profile, etc.

This example simulates the flow through a uniform inclined screen using the Screen feature in Single-Phase Flow physics and compares the results with an analytic solution due to Elder.

The combined effect of resistance and refraction (suppression of the tangential velocity component) creates a non-uniform velocity profile on the downstream side of the screen. An asymptotic solution
valid for small inclinations.

To facilitate comparison with the asymptotic solution, we assume that the flow is incompressible and apply free-slip boundary conditions on the channel walls. Then, we choose the user-defined option for 
both the screen type and refraction in order to set the resistance coefficient K to 2.2 and the refraction coefficient Î· to 0.78.
